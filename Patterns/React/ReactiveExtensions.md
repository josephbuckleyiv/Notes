## Use

When injesting events from disparate sources. 
Remember. It makes your life easier, not more difficult. This will be the major React pitfall.


## Library

Use RXJS -- it has the most support. Although some may argue that it's not 'idiomatic' with React, used sparingly it serves its purpose.
