# Conventions
Use Microsofts Conventions. This makes the code more readable -- casing and style is not legibility of handwriting but rather grammar. The notion of individual style, while clearly present, should not be determined by strange casing, and obtuse variable names.
For this reason, everything and it's mother are 'services.'


## Fields
Fields are _thisCase.


## Files
Files are capital (they are tickety-boo!) and hence are titled PascalCase.

## Methods
Methods are written in PascalCase.

## Properties
Properties are clandestine methods, so like methods they get neat PascalCase.

## Service Injection
Always .AddSomething()!
