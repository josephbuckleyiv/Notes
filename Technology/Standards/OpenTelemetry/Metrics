Remember OpenTelemetry is way of _thinking_ about Telemetry.
## Terminology
### Counter

### Asynchronous Counter
Same as counter but collected _once_ for each export. Used if you don't have access to continuous 
increments.
### UpDown Counter
Counter that can go ... wait for it... up and down e.g
### Asynchronous UpDown Counter
### Gauge
Measures a current value at the time it is read e.g CPU usage.
### Asynchrnonous Gauge
### Histogram
A client-side aggregation of values. Good choice if you are interested in value statistics.
### Metrics Provider
Created once per program.
### Aggregation
Technique whereby a large number of measurements are combined into either exact or estimated stats
about metric events that took place during a time window.
