# Kerberos
## Idea:
Distributed system, a file system, mail-server, printer etc. and various users. Kerberos introduces a
specific Kerberos server [KDC]. Trust lies: in Kerberos server and in user workstation.
\
Users have keys. Keys are stored in the KDC. Servers have keys. Key distribution center. Two interfaces,
TGS (Ticket-granting service) and 'Kerberos.' First, you get ticket from Kerberos by passing your client key.
Then, you get ticket for a particular server by communicating with TGS. Entities are called Principals.
\ 
How do we ask for the right entity? We ask Kerberos Server. Then, we get a string. Each individual 
networked resource should manage ACLs to authorize a 'string.' Service principals need their own name -- 
user principals want verification they are communicating with the correct service principal. Reclaiming 
principal names difficult with lack of versioning.
\
Client sends (C,S) to Kerberos. Kerberos server responds with {T(C,S), K(C,S)} encrypted with K(C). 
Since it encrypts with K(C) it does not care about authenticating client.
## Terminology
### Ticket
Data structure that looks like T(C,S) = { s, c, ipaddr, timestamp, ttl, Shared Key }
### Authenticator
Data structure A(C) = { c, addr, timestamp }, typically encrypted with the key generated by the T(C,S)
